    <h1>Ducks - The good</h1>
    <p>Most varieties of ducks which humans slaughter for food are descended from mallards, which are still wild and live in many parts of the world.  They can live over twenty years, with some breeds living up to thirty five.</p>
    <p>It is mainly the females which give the stereotypical "quack" as males voices change as they get older.</p>
    <p>Ducklings, adorably cute as they are, start to lose their yellow feathers at about a month of age, and by three to four months have developed feathers mature enough to fly.</p>
    <p>They are dependent in their early months on the oil secretions of their mothers to be waterproof, which they get by constant close contact, but as they mature start producing the oil themselves.  Mother ducks will only let her ducklings spend brief periods in the water, which ensures they are safe until their feathers mature.</p>
    <p>Rescued ducks can become very loyal companions for people, and bond strongly once a relationship of trust is established.</p>
