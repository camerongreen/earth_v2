  <h1>Ducks - the bad</h1>
  <p>Ducks are more difficult to confine, and produce less meat per individual than chickens, and this has meant they are not as comparitively profitable.  They are generally slaughtered when they are seven weeks old.</p>
  <p>Like chickens, they are often kept in "battery cages" stacked rows of wire cages into which a number of birds will be crammed, usually close enough that they can't move without touching another bird or spread their wings.  Water, not only te environment they are adapted for, is essential for the health of ducks as they use it to preen and clean themselves, is not provided to them in battery cages or often in other intensive systems like barns.</p>
  <p>They are bred through insemination and the eggs are taken and incubated under lights, with machines turning the eggs regularly which would usually be done by their mother.</p>
  <p>All wild species of ducks are able to fly, however there are many domesticated species that have lost this ability in captivity.</p>
  <p>Ducks undergo one of the most inhumane practises of food production, foie gras, where they are force fed through metal tubes down their throats in order to enlarge their livers, which is then made into pate.</p>
  <p>The main predator of wild ducks are human hunters, who appear to find some self glorification in using shotguns to shoot an animal that, if you scatter some seeds on the ground, will happily come near you.</p>
