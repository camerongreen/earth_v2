I tried to get a domain with the word Earth in it, but couldn't so I finally just registered my name.</p>
<p>Each page has its own introduction, articles, links, media and quotes. As you can see I like quotes, putting something succinctly is...good...stuff.  The Links in the pages have been very carefully selected and I would appreciate it if you find a great page you think might be appropriate or find a  link which no longer works, be a good netizen and let me know. The articles are by me and I hope you like some of them. If you have anything to submit, videos, articles, quotes, links, please do, and feedback also makes me happy so use the Contact form liberally (actually do everything liberally ;).</p>
<p>As for the name E.A.R.T.H. it came to me when I was in the kind of twilight stage between being asleep and awake one day, and I thought it summed up well the specific areas I wished to concentrate on. As you will see from the pages and links, I believe the world can be a better place, and in action towards that goal.</p>
<p>Every shred of the work on this website has been done with free and open source software, in other words Microsoft and Apple have had nothing to do with it.  The role of open source software honour involved includes PHP, MySQL, Apache, Linux, Gvim, Drupal, Gimp, Perl, Sass and Firefox.  I must caveat this alas for the latest version, I used PHPStorm as I was using this at work and wanted to get greater familiarity with it.</p>
<p>Now a bit of history of my pages...</p>
<p>My very first homepage which I started in 1996 was pretty eclectic (euphemism for crappy), intense background images, animated gifs, think I even had a blinking alien on it somewhere.</p>
<p>In 1998/99 I decided to do a page from the ground up during my first summer break at Uni. Hopefully reflecting the things I really care about a bit more, and the broadening of my computer skills.  If you really want to check it out <a href="../old.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">click here for the old version</a> in all it's umm.. glory.  The site was the first I did which was XHTML compliant, used Cascading Style Sheets, and had some funky browser independent Javascript. It couldn't be 100% XHTML compliant page, because I used frames....stupid W3C. </p>
<p>It used to run on my Fedora Linux box, however when I moved to London I moved it to a service provider which is why it runs slower now.<br />
Before I ran it on the Linux box I used to host the page at defy.virtualave.net, back in the days of free websites for all, until one day I discovered that my email form didn't work, even worse it looked like it worked, displaying a confirmation message saying 'thanks for your input', but it just silently never delivered the email to me. No one ever notified me of this, who knows how long it was like that and how many emails I never received because of it. I tried all sorts of things to get it to work to no avail. I sent the admins there an email in the feedback form which said 'give a detailed description of your problem', of course the feedback form sent back an automatic reply saying they don't give email feedback anymore. Why it didn't say this on the email form page, rather than 'give a detailed description of your problem' you will have to ask the virtualave admins (if you can find some way to contact them). Anyway with all the ads and lack of configurability at virtualave, that was the last straw, having no more straws, indeed being completely and utterly strawless and without straw, I purchased my own name camerongreen.org, and I moved the whole thing across until I could find some way to procure more straw.</p>
<p>This was at godaddy, until I found out the founder shot an elephant, now it is hosted at Hostgator.com which is powered by 130% wind energy :)</p>
<p>This latest version is rewritten using Drupal as a CMS, yet again as the result of new skills.  I've also gotten rid of frames to help with linkability and navigation throughout the site.  I've used GIMP for all the images (though I stole the picture of the earth on the front page from somewhere).  It's not 100% XHTML compliant, the world seems to have turned its back on that.  Using a CMS makes controlling that sort of thing harder but will still try to make it well formed etc.  My intention is to upgrade everything on the site, look, navigation, articles, till I'm happy with it.</p>
<p>I'd like to do more work on it, but I have to earn a living writing other people's websites, cest la vie.</p>
<p>I really hope you enjoy you enjoy your stay on E.A.R.T.H., please visit again as I am always working on it.</p>
<p>Peace - Cameron</p>
