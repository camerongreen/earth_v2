Narrated by Leonardo Di Caprio, beautifully shot and very accessible film.  Hopefully will change the way you think. (Unfortunately this is no longer available free online...not sure what the thinking is there)</p>",

I can only imagine this is because they know what they are going to see, and it is going to confront them with questions of morality they are afraid to ask.  Every time you purchase an animal product you are casting a vote for how those animals live their lives.  Seeing as you have this control over the lives of animals, the least you can do is educate yourself as to what you are supporting.  This video will start that education.</p>",

Most people I know don't have a shred of antisemetism in them, perhaps like myself they even have a positive bias towards the Jewish culture, ancient and learned as it is.  This is completely separate to my condemnation of the actions of the Israeli government in the occupied territories.  We cannot wash away our moral failings by blaming them on the provocations of others, Israel must end it's occupation of Palestine and help them develop into a viable nation.  Any hope of peace in the middle east is in their hands.</p>",
