  <h1>Goats - the bad</h1>
  <p>Goats have been generally been spared the intensive conditions of factory farms more than most other animals humans consume.  Due to their eating habits, they have been resistant to confined conditions, and thus are often farmed in a free range manner.</p>
  <p>They can be dehorned soon after birth, horns are living bone and this procedure is done without any anaesthetic.</p>
  <p>Goats moreso than other commercially farmed animals are sometimes allowed to breed normally, however artificial insemination is becoming increasingly popular due to commercial pressures.</p>
  <p>The does are regularly impregnated to keep their milk supply at it's optimum level.</p> 
  <p>Male kids in dairy breeds are generally taken from their mothers and slaughtered soon after birth.  Those kept for meat are typically castrated, again without anaesthetic.</p>
  <p>Most goats bred for meat are killed before they are one year old.</p>
