    <h1>Fish - The good</h1>
    <p>The term fish describes a vast array of completely different species, almost as broad as the term animal describes.</p>
    <p>From the often maligned gold fish, who's memory has been proven time and time again not to be 5 seconds as popular mythology ascribes to it, to larger fish who have been shown to remember for long periods where to avoid predators, there is a range of cognitive abilities we are only beginning to understand.  In a well known defense of the gold fish, one ingeneous person taught them to play a simple form of soccer as an example of their learning abilities.</p>
    <p>Fish like all other animals enjoy pleasure, a study into why fish would come to "cleaning stations" where smaller fish would eat parasites from the skin of larger fish, found that tickling a fish with a soft instrument produced the same behaviour in the larger fish.</p>
    <p>Like other animals, fish have been shown to be able to use tools, have complex social structures, exhibit cooperation and other individual personality traits.</p>
