    <h1>Cows - The good</h1>
    <p>Domestic cows originated from a small group of individuals called aurochs in Turkey, and some breeds today still bear a distinct resemblance to their forebears though aurochs themselves became extinct in the 17th century.</p>
    <p>A herding social animal, they can live into their late 40s with a gestation period similar to humans.</p>
    <p>Like all animals, including the human, their maternal instinct is very strong.  After birth a cow will hide her calf, even from other members of the herd, and once they rejoin the herd, stay in close contact via smell and distinctive callings.   Whilst most people's interactions with cows is one of a peaceful, gentle creature, this can change quite suddenly if a cow feels her calf is threatened.</p>
    <p>In the wild their herds would be composed of a matriachal family grouping, with mature bulls generally leading more solitary lives, or forming their own groupings.</p>
    <p>It is well documented that when a calf dies or is taken away, the mother cow will grieve, often for days, calling her calf back to her.</p>
