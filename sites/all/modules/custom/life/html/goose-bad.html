  <h1>Geese - the bad</h1>
  <p>Geese have been selectively bred to be 2 to 3 times larger than their wild relatives, which has resulted in them being unable to fly.  The stereo typical posture of a goose, standing almost upright, is not a natural phenomena and is brought about by the changes in their physiology of this breeding.</p>
  <p>Selective breeding has also meant they lay vastly more eggs than they do naturally, up to four times as many.</p>
  <p>Factory farmed geese live out their lives in cramped, dirty sheds, without sunlight and the ability to pursue their natural behaviours.</p>
  <p>Geese share with ducks the unfortunate distinction of being subject to one of the cruelest of all farming practises, the production of foie gras.  This involves force feeding the geese much more food than they would naturally want to eat, usually by grasping them around the neck and pumping more food into them directly via a metal tube up to four times a day.  This often causes injuries to the throats of the geese, and is something few people who eat foie gras would voluntarily wish to witness.  During this period they are often housed in small cages, in which they are sometimes unable to move, to ensure handling them is easier as they try to resist their distressing circumstances.  They are then slaughtered, have their livers removed, and this is then served up to incredibly thoughtless people.</p>
