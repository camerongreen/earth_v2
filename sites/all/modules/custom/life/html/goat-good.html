    <h1>Goats - The good</h1>
    <p>Domesticated goats are descended from a wild species called the Bezoar which still lives an endangered existence in parts of Asia, Europe and the Middle East.  They are also distant cousins of sheep and this is very evident when looked at wild sheep, but they can be told apart because goats short tails generally point upwards, whilst sheeps longer tails point downwards.</p>
    <p>They live in matriachal herds which can be quite large, with male goats living solitary lives.</p>
    <p>Does or nannies as female goats are called are pregnant for 5-6 months, and once they give birth the kids can walk very quickly and follow their mothers.</p>
    <p>Goats can live over twenty years of age and reach puberty at about a year old.</p>
    <p>Well known for their intelligence, they can be difficult to keep confined due to their ability to find weaknesses in fencing.  They have an excellent sense of balance, as one can see from the way they feed on grasses on steep hillsides, and often climb trees they find if they aren't overly steep.</p>
