    <h1>Turkeys - The good</h1>
    <p>The domestic turkey is descended from the wild turkey still common in North America.</p>
    <p>Their wild cousins can fly for short to medium distances, to get to perches and evade predators.</p>
    <p>One interesting fact is that male turkeys heads change colours according to their emotions, from red, to blue to white when they are really excited.</p>
    <p>Male turkeys will often pair up with another male in displays of courtship and this has been found to be a more successful evolutionary strategy with them fathering more poults, as baby turkeys are called, then turkeys displaying on their own.</p>
    <p>Turkeys have an expressive variety of calls to each other, which they emit either from their vocal chords or an air sack in their chest.</p>
    <p>After laying her eggs, the turkey hen will lay on her eggs for around a month.  Once the poults hatch, although quite independent straight away, they are unable to fly for the first couple of weeks and will stay close to their mother.  The spend the first year of their life close to their mother, after which males will generally start to leave the flock.</p>
