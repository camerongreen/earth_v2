</span>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>"Its Connection With Political &amp; Social Circumstances". Bertrand Russell is a wonderful philosopher and author, and this is the classic introduction to philosophy. His range of knowledge is vast, his insight into the great philosophers is excellent, and at times his wit is wonderfully understated. I would recommend this book, as the history of thoughts reveals something about the processes of history that have led to ourselves. When thinking about the great thinkers of the past who have believed such ridiculous things, we can see how long humanity has struggled with its own limitations. The people of most times in history have believed things, sometime based their entire life upon things, that we know today with the perfect science of hindsight to be completely baseless. This is a message from the ages to us all, just how important doubt needs to be integrated into our own thinking, without paralysing us into inaction. Russell's thought is not dry and academic, he doesn't pull his punches, and I can't say the book left me with much respect for any philosopher before relatively modern times. It did however leave me with a profound respect for Bertrand Russell, and I would highly recommend this, or any other of his writings.</p>

</span>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>I first saw the television show "Philosophy: A Guide to Happiness" and enjoyed it immensely. On finding out the series was based on the book, I couldn't wait to read it. Basically it is an attempt to bring philosophy into our everyday lives. Sure a lot of philosophy is stupid and rambles on about whether a chair really exists or not, but over the thousands of years and millions of words, some good has come of it. De Botton is very selective about what he chooses from each philosopher, Neitzsche, who was in actuality a complete bastard, is portrayed as a misguided soul searching for love, and the bits where he recommends taking a whip to a women are left out. Socrates who said all sorts of stupid things about how the gods could be logically proved to exist, becomes a martyr of the highest order dying the perfect death to show us all how unpopularity is often the nobler course. Really when it comes down to it, should we let peoples vast stupidity blind us from the positive and helpful things they might have to say that can help us in our own lives? Even the dullest mind it seems can be really right about something when others around them are blind to it. This is a fabulous book, and I really loved the parts about Epicurus. This book achieves what it sets out to do, give us a philisophical insight into ourselves through the words of the great philosophers, and it is written in a witty, idiosyncratic and amusing style. Very enjoyable read.</p>

</span>  </div>  
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>There are few much more maligned books than this, I first heard about it in high school from a friend who used to joke about the sort of people who read books like it, so often indeed that it stuck in my mind. Well wherever you are Jesse, I'm sorry but I became one of those people who read a book like this. I can only think people dislike it because they baulk at the title and never actually read the book, which is at worst harmless and at best an example of how people should treat each other in a kinder more productive way. It is written from the perspective of those who would be leaders of people, and how to wield that power in such a way as you not only influence people, but you win friends at the same time. It is full of quaint stories and examples which illustrate the points well. For example, the point of listening to all opinions is made by a large group of men with all sorts of machinery trying to remove a truck which had gotten stuck under a bridge, a passing young girl mentioned that letting the tyres down might be a good idea, saving them many hours of trouble because they chose to listen to her. It has stories about many famous people, often American political leaders, and how they dealt with people and problems, showing by the example of some of the most successful people in history how we might do things differently in our own lives. Every one I have gotten to read this book has enjoyed it, most have loved it, some have even bought their own copies and one even bought me an extra lending copy he enjoyed it so much. It is like having a conversation with a wise elderly person about how to get on in the world.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>I don't want to say too much about this book.  I really enjoyed reading it, I read a lot of technical books, a lot of other hard to read books, and I found this just a perfect breather in between them.</p>
<p>The main message that stands out to me from the book, is that there are many ways to "enlightenment", which I guess I would define as a contentment with your place in the world whilst engaging with the problems of the world at the same time.</p>
<p>I wouldn't read this book without first having an understanding of what Buddhism has to say, so What the Buddha Taught which I reviewed earlier, would be a good precursor to this classic.</p>
