    <h1>Chickens - The good</h1>
    <p>Domestic chickens are descended from Red Junglefowl, indeed in places where they have escaped human captivity they have reverted back to being called junglefowl.</p>
    <p>The males especially have a complicated vocal range, and have a variety of calls to identify different sorts of predators, to warn rivals, and of course to woo the hens.  Roosters will often perform a dance to accompany this.</p>
    <p>Social birds, they live up to 16 years in flocks with strict hierarchies.  They can fly for short distances, to escape danger, to reach roosting sites and to inspect their surroundings.</p>
    <p>Naturally hens would only continue to lay until they had a clutch of eggs.  They would then nest on them, called brooding, until they can hear their chicks making peeping noises inside their eggs, which they will return with a gentle clucking to encourage them to come out.  Once her chicks emerge, the mother hen will spend up to two months nurturing, protecting and showing them food sources until they become more independent.</p>
    <p>Many people keep chickens purely as companion animals, and an oft repeated comment about their experiences with chickens is the enjoyment they find in discovering each chickens unique personality.</p>
