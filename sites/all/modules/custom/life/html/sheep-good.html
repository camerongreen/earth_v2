    <h1>Sheep - The good</h1>
    <p>The domestic sheeps origins are a little cloudy, but they are thought to have descended from the Mouflon, a wild sheep with large horns still living in Europe and Asia.</p>
    <p>Wild sheep are various shades of brown, a colour which has largely been selectively bred out of them in order that their wool, also selectively bred in its "modern" form, can be more easily dyed.</p>
    <p>An interesting debate in the scientific community is whether (no pun intended) they have canine teeth, which according to popular human culture will inevitably lead to arguments about whether they are meant to eat meat.</p> 
    <p>Sheep can live up to 20 years of age, can see behind themselves without moving their heads, and have an excellent sense of smell and hearing.</p>
    <p>Domestic sheep have very pronounced herding instincts, and naturally form very strong bonds to their groups and when removed from their flock, they become stressed.  They have an excellent sense of others as individuals and can remember fellow flock members and even humans for years.</p>
    <p>Sheep will generally avoid danger if they can, however if cornered or their lambs are threated will charge.</p>
    <p>Sheep are also tender mothers, who constantly keep a check on their lambs, and they will recognise each others voices when they call.</p>
