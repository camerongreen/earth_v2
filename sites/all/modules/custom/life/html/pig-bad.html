  <h1>Pigs - the bad</h1>
  <p>Pigs in factory farms lead a life which is a hollow image of their natural existence.</p>
  <p>Those that don't die on the concrete floors their mothers lie on to give birth are taken from their mothers at two to three weeks.  They often have their canine teeth removed and tail docked without anaesthetic and are sent to be confined in crowded stalls for the rest of their prematurely short lives.  Like most mammals, they look to their mother for protection and as a role model as they grow, but instead this deep and ancient bond is ignored for the sake of efficiency.</p> 
  <p>They are killed when it is most profitable at around 6 months of age, though naturally they can live over 20 years.  Sows and boars used for breeding are kept alive longer than six months, though they don't physically mate.  The boars semen is collected by farm workers and used to artificially inseminate the females.  Once their ability to reproduce most profitably diminishes, they will be sent to be slaughtered.</p>
  <p>Sows are kept in tiny farrowing crates during their pregnancy, lying on concrete floors, in which they are unable to turn around.  Many pigs won't even make it alive to the slaughter house, a study published in "The National Hog Farmer" in 2002 stated that 170,000 pigs were killed each year on the way to the slaughterhouse, with 420,000 being crippled.</p>
  <p>The pigs natural varied natural diet is cut down to a monotonous one of (often subsidised) grain which is something they would rarely eat in the wild.  This is indicative of a life in which their natural instincts will be almost completely denied.  Sows will not get to raise their children or live in the matriarchal family communities in which they live in the wild.  Far from being able to make nests, they will never see grass, the sky, or even a patch of dirt, instead these clean animals will live a life in sheds, on concrete floors, in stalls so small they have to lie in their own bodily excretions.</p>
  <p>Being such intelligent creatures, this life of confinement in which have no contact with the natural world, causes psychological problems.  Pigs display many signs of their emotional distress, head bobbing, biting the steel bars, turning on each other.</p>
  <p>Given that studies show that pigs are more intelligent than domestic dogs, and that if someone treated their dog in this manner people of conscience would want them to be prosecuted, one has to ask what rationality behind this treatment of pigs?  Of course the only rational is self interest, enabled by wilful ignorance.  People have a simple choice, either be an ethical person, or continue paying for these intelligent animals to live lives completely devoid of the conditions required to find any happiness.</p>
