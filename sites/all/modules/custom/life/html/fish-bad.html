    <h1>Fish - The bad</h1>
    <p>Fish for most of our history have been caught from the wild, and it is only recently and partly due to our unsustainable depletion of stocks in the wild, that humans have started to farm fish on a large scale.</p>
    <p>Because fish are so very different to us, the brutal treatment of them is tolerated in a way which is thought horrific when meted out to any other animal.  The "sport" of fishing for instance, as well as many methods of commercial capture, involve impaling a sharpened hook through their mouth, head, eye etc, and then pulling their body weight through and out of the water by that hook, leaving them to basically suffocate, often in a huge pile of their distressed brethren.</p>
    <p>Fish have a central nervous system in many ways similar to our own, so it would be counter intuitive to think they did not feel pain in a similar way that we do, and studies have only ever pointed in the direction of confirming that fact (as much as we are ever able).</p>
    <p>Fish farming, much like factory farming on land, is a dirty and much impoverished way for these creatures to live.  They are often fed drugs to stop the overcrowding leading to disease, which in turn contribute to things like antibiotic resistance.  Due to the fact that many of the more profitable fish are carnivorous, the unfortunate fish in the farms are only kept alive, by the destructive fishing practises in wild populations, that have seen almost every major wild fishery collapse, or in a state of decline.</p>
