    <h1>Pigs - The good</h1>
    <p>Domestic pigs are descended from wild boars with whom they still share many traits, and are distant cousins of whales and hippopotami.</p>
    <p>Highly social and renowned for their intelligence, animal cognition has shown that they are fast to learn and understand, whilst being slow to forget.  Studies have shown them to be certainly smarter than dogs for instance, yet the way we treat them as a society is very different.</p>
    <p>People know even less about the natural lives of pigs than they do of the lives of pigs in factory farms.  For instance pigs like to make nests out of undergrowth material, twigs, sticks etc.  They use these for communal sleep areas and sows will also make nests as private places to birth and raise their piglets.</p>
    <p>Pigs display many aspects of intelligence, even trying to fool each other.  When one pig journeys to a food source and other pigs recognise that they may be on to something starting follow them, the initial pig will use evasive tactics to throw the other pigs off their (curly) tail.</p>
    <p>Naturally they would live in small matriarchal groups of up to 20 females and piglets, with adult males generally living solitary lives until breeding season.  They forage widely, eating an omnivorous diet mainly based on leaves, flowers, roots, fruits and grasses.<p>
