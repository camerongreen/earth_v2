  <h1>Cows - the bad</h1>
  <p>Over the last few decades, dairy cows have been selectively bred to have abnormally large udders which produce over twice as much milk as they had previously.  Cows do not produce milk unless they have been impregnated, and they continue to produce milk for about a year after giving birth.  They are impregnated by artificial insemination, generally a few months after giving birth, being kept pregnant most of their entire, unnaturally short lives, without ever being able to be a proper mother.</p>
 <p>They are slaughtered for many reasons, their rate of milk production isn't profitable enough, either naturally or as a result of aging, they have succumbed to disease, such as those exacerbated by overmilking such as mastitis, they develop lameness, partially caused by the unnatural grain heavy diet they are fed, or they become infertile.  The average life span of a dairy cow is three to four years, at which point they are sent to slaughterhouses as low grade beef, often in processed meat products.</p>
  <p>Naturally cows are ruminants, eating primarily grass and other vegetation, but the diet on which they are often fed in large factory farms is grain heavy, which is unhealthy for the cows, and they are also fed an almost bizzarre array of byproducts of other intensive animal manufacturing industries, chicken waste, turkey feathers, even the unsaleable body parts of other cows, though the BSE scare has made that practise less common.</p>
  <p>The age at which a calf is taken from its mother is of some discussion in the cattle farming community as to what is most profitable.  Some believe it should be taken in the first day so that the mother doesn't get a chance to bond with it and become more stressed on it being taken.  Others point to the fact that the more days a calf is with its mother, the better socialised it becomes as a herd member, and that it puts on much more weight when it is with it's mother.  A calf is fed on a cheap powdered milk like substance, often byproducts of cheese making, whilst its own mothers milk is taken for human consumption.</p>
  <p>Male calves from dairy breeds are generally destined for the veal market. In countries which have not banned the practise due to pressure from animal activists, calves are kept in crates so that they cannot move and develop muscle tissue, without sunlight and the touch of any other animal.  Even in countries which have banned the practise, the calves are generally taken from their mothers and kept indoors in pens, sometimes isolated individually, for their whole short lives, which can be anything from a couple of days to five months of age depending on the veal product which will be made.</p> 
  <p>Male cattle not intended for veal consumption will generally be castrated at birth and killed at some point before they are three years old.  Males kept for breeding, do not actually mate with females, rather their semen is collected and inserted into the cows when it is most profitable to do so.  The breeding cattle, as with all cows in the system, are destined for the slaughterhouse eventually as well.</p>
  <p>Cows/Cattle endure many excrutiatingly painful procedures at various stages of their lives, castration, tail cutting, branding, dehorning, are all done without anaesthetic.</p>
  <p>Modern cattle farming is increasingly moving towards intensive production, keeping animals clustered in grassless, fenced environments, in amidst their own dung, fed on unnatural diets that are most profitable.</p>
