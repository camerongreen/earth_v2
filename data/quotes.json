If I don�t throw them back, they�ll die.� �Son,� the man said, �don�t you realize there are miles and miles of beach and hundreds of starfish?�You can�t make a difference!� After listening politely, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish,�and threw it back into the surf.�Then, smiling at the man, he said��I made a difference for that one.�",

Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom to more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them.

These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very, very edge of despair.  I have sought love first because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great I would often have sacrificed all the rest of my life for a few hours of that joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieved loneliness - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined, This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what - at last - I have found.  Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate the evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.  This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me",
