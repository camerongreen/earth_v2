  <h1>Chickens - the bad</h1>
  <p>Many animals live terrible lives in factory farms, but none on the scale of chickens.</p>
  <p>The majority of the worlds egg laying hens live in stacked cages, without enough room to stretch their wings, the equivalent of a piece of paper.  Most of the rest are crowded into barns, away from the natural world.  They are kept from brooding or anything that might halt the production of eggs, which they have been selectively bred to produce constantly.  A practise called "forced molting" is practised in some places, which involves withholding food and water from the hens for up to two weeks, in order for them to force the hends into a more productive following laying season.  Once their maximum fertility is deemed to be passed, they are then sent to slaughter.  Male chicks of course never get to this point, they are killed straight away, either through gassing, crushing or grinding.</p>
  <p>Chickens meant for consumption fare little better.  Selectively bred over generations to grow at an abnormal rate, their bodies can barely support their own weight, bone problems are common and heart problems related to their unnatural phsyiology means they die prematurely at a rate many times that of laying hens.  Instead of the usual rate of growth which sees chickens reach a mature size at five to six months, the breeding means they grow to slaughtering size in as little as five to six weeks.</p>
  <p>Chicks are kept under continual light to encourage them to eat, as they get older the light in their sheds is gradually dimmed to reduce their level of physical activity, but to keep them awake enough to eat, with a short period of darkness of about four hours to give them a mininum of rest. Their sheds are generally not cleaned during an individuals lifespan, so they spend much of their life walking on faeces, the air becomes quite toxic so ventilation systems are required.  There is no last meal for these chickens, as with many animals they are starved in the days prior to slaughter to reduce intestinal content.</p>
  <p>Being kept in unnaturally confined conditions stresses the birds, and they exhibit behaviours such as increased violence towards each other.  To mitigate this the top portion of the beaks of the bird is burned off when they are chicks.  The beak is a sensitive part of the chickens anatomy and this is of course done without anaesthetic.</p>
  <p>None of these chickens will ever feel the sun on their face, have grass under their feet, peck for unexpected things in the soil, perch or be able to pursue many of their natural instincts.  The logic of their lifecycle is profit, so that you the consumer can have their flesh as cheap as possible, and so long as that happens, you are happy to ask no questions about the consequences of your actions on these social and pleasure seeking individuals.</p>
