  <h1>Sheep - the baad</h1>
  <p>Sheep have been spared the intensive conditions of factory farms more than most other animals humans consume.  Alas lambs are sometimes an exception to this, often placed in crowded feedlots before slaughter.</p>
  <p>They have been selectively bred to grow wool at such an extent that they have become dependent upon us to shear them.</p>
  <p>Some of the worst practises involving sheep, are the castration of males and the cutting off the sheeps tail, both without anaesthetic.</p>
  <p>One of the worst practises involving sheep called "mulesing" is commonly done in Australia, one of the world's largest wool producers, where a sheeps tail, the area around the tail and parts from the back of their legs are cut off without anaesthetic to prevent them getting infested with flies.  This is partly caused by the unnatural skin folds and increased wool growth that they have been bred to produce.</p>
  <p>They have also been selectively bred to produce multiple lambs per pregnancy which causes more difficult births and greater infant mortality.</p>
  <p>Shearing is a frightening process to sheep, and the commercial pressures of the shearing floor mean there is a lot of "casual brutality" towards the sheep.</p>
  <p>Once lambs are taken from their mothers they can be killed from the age of 4 weeks, though 3 or 4 months is more common, and they are technically still a lamb at up to a year.  Both the lamb and it's mother understandably are badly stressed by being separated from each other.</p>
