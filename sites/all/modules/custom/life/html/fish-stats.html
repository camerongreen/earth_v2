    <p>The average slaughtered weight of a fish was obtained from the study done by the website http://fishcount.org.uk.  This figure is an average of all fish killed, rather than fish used for food by humans.  The sort of fish eaten in different countries varies widely, so therefore the weight would as well, for instance Australians eat up to 200 species, but a few fish dominate this.</p>
    <p>So why are the numbers for fish so large, well it includes all sea creatures.  Mussels, oysters, a pizza with small prawns on it, anchovies, sardines, these can add up in a way larger animals don't.  The numbers of by catch in fishing are huge as well, up to 50% are "non target species".  Finally you have fish farming, which often involves catching larger numbers of fish to feed the farmed fish.  All up, fishcount calculates that over a trillion fish are killed every year, and it is these numbers reflected here.</p>
