  <h1>Turkeys - the bad</h1>
  <p>Like a hens chicks, in industrial farms turkey poults will never see their mother, or the sky.  They are taken as eggs, incubated, hatched, have their sensitive beaks burned off, and overfed for their unaturally short lives all in windowless sheds.  The sheds generally don't have windows so that lighting conditions can be used to manipulate their feeding, sleeping etc.</p>
  <p>Overcrowding is the industry practise, with even best practise guidelines in the US not giving bird nearly enough room to stand without touching another bird.  This overcrowding increases stress in the birds, and rules out or makes difficult many of their natural behaviours such as dust bathing.  Turkeys have lost the inability to fly in domestication, mainly due to being selectively bred to be so large.</p>
  <p>Bred over generations to be up to twice as heavy as their wild cousins, male turkeys can no longer breed with hens without injuring them, so as in other forms of animal rearing, insemination is done artificially.  Their massive growth rates mean all sorts of bone and leg problems for the turkeys.</p>
  <p>Lighting is also used to manipulate the birds, being kept low to keep them inactive and reduce aggression caused by their unnatural crowded conditions, but also used to induce them to eat more, either by keeping it on continuously, or making it intermittent to immitate shorter days.  Long, low level light periods can cause eye problems and blindness.</p>
  <p>Aggression in turkeys is common, and due to their confined conditions, victims have no avenue of escape and can be killed.</p>
