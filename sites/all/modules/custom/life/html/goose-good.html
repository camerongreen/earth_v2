    <h1>Geese - The good</h1>
    <p>Geese are from a large and ancient family of birds including ducks and swans.  The domestic goose is a domesticated grey goose, a species present from the subarctic to more temperate regions.</p>
    <p>Geese undertake some amazing migrations, and have been seen flying at tremendous heights, with some species crossing over the Himalayas in their annual migrations of thousands of miles.</p>
    <p>Geese mate for life, which can be well over 40 years, and are monogamous.</p>
